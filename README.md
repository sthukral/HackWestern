## Inspiration
Currently in the Covid Pandemic, at the vaccine clinics, there are TWO systems that employees are responsible for maintaining. The first is the provincial system, and the second is each municipality's vaccine data collection system. Unfortunately, the municipality systems are often faulty and take up too much time to maintain causing longer wait times for people getting their vaccines (and now, the booster dose).

This problem has highlighted several areas in the Ontario health care system that can be improved:
- Employees at vaccine clinics have to enter patient information a second time into the municipal systems - and this takes a significant amount of time for thousands of patients.
- The lack of communication between physicians causes patients to have to repeat their concerns to any new physician that they visit. Patient Histories are not shared between physicians.

## What it does
HealthyMe is the missing link in this multifaceted problem. The primary function of this app is to easily allow vaccine clinic workers to check-in patients into the database.

But as development continued, HealthyMe will also allow for physician-physician communication, allowing for a standardized experience for all patients. 
_italics_ Studies have shown that patients who suffer mental trauma and have to repeat their history to each new physician that they might meet, further exacerbate their mental health.

## How we built it
The app was built primarily using Node Js and MongoDB using an MVC model. This will allow for the continuous growth and development of the app.

## Challenges we ran into
Deciding on which features are necessary for physicians. A further survey will have to finalize these options. The idea is that this app will be a CRM of sorts for physicians

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A working front-facing app!

## What we learned
This was my first time using Node and Javascript! I am SUPER thrilled about my achievement!

## What's next for HealthyMe
Continue working on the app to add more (and better) functionality! Learn more about databases and making them secure!
